# weather-dashboard

For this weeks challenge I was tasked to create a weather dashboard. I decided to use the bulma css framework as I was learning how to use it pretty heavily over the past few days. I created the javascript in coordination with the framework. Each javascript function played an important role in the operation of the site. I started with a function to fetch the weather api using my api key. This function is very straight foward. The next function was fetching he 5 day forecast. It is very identical to the current weather forecast but fetches the response for 5 days. The function for updating current weather of the cit was straight foward. I wanted a main full length card for that as it was most important. The function to update the 5 day forecast was the most complicated function as it needed to create each card for the day. It looks messy but it actively updates the html nicely with each content card. Then lastly an event listener for the input field for the city.
